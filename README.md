# RGB Display-Industrial Grade RISC-V MCU – CH643
EN | [中文](README_zh.md)



### Overview
The CH643 is an RGB display industrial-grade MCU based on RISC-V core.Built-in 3*16-channel PWM current drive, support COM scanning. Supports 192 groups of RGB or 576 single-color LEDs without extra PMOS.The CH643 built-in USB and PD PHY,supports USB Host and USB Device functions, USB PD and type C fast charging functions, built-in programmable protocol I/O controller.The CH643 provides 2 groups of OPA operational amplifiers, 3 groups of CMP voltage comparators, 4 groups of USART serial ports, I2C, SPI, multi-group timers, 12-bit ADC, 15-way Touchkey and other rich peripheral resources.
